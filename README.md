# i3-nord
## So These are my dot files for a nord-theme i3-gaps configuration:

- **WM related apps:** i3-gaps - [betterlockscreen](https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen) - rofi - i3bar - pulseaudio, networkmanager, blueman and clipit applets.

- **Fonts:** Lato (for most of the ui) and Fira Code (for terminal, text editor, etc..)

- **GTK and QT themes:** nord gtk theme and kvantum nord theme

- **Cursor:** Breeze

- **Icons:** [papirus nordic folders](https://github.com/basigur/papirus-folders)

- **Terminal:** [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (DT made a great [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZPMvTvUf1Y&t=759s) on it)

- I use flameshot for screenshots (used scrot to capture the rofi menu tho).

- I also added a script to change keyboard layouts that show the current layout on the bar.

- To configure QT apps I use Kvantum and qt5ct.
- I mostly use lxde/lxqt cuz they get the job done and are very light on resources and dependencies. I prefer their apps to the xfce apps.
